# BusTracker


Description 

This is a small project completed by me during the MIT Full Stack Dev Bootcamp. This exercise is based on JavaScript and prebuilt functions from MapBox to create an animation showing the bus route from University of Tampa's campus to University of South Florida's.

Usage

To download, click the "Fork" button on the top right corner to clone the repository. When done, open the folder in which the files are stored, and open the index.html file in your browser. Wait for the map to load in. Click the button in the top left corner to start the animation.

Roadmap

As it is right now, this project only shows a very basic animation using one route. However, in the future this program could be updated to show many or even all of the bus routes in the greater Tampa.

This is a fun little project that showcases my expanding knowledge. 
Enjoy!
